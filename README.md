# Bomberman
My first java program with sound and graphics, recreating to somewhat degree the bomberman game

## Technologies
* JDK 8u111

## TODO
* Graphical Improvement would be nice
* Proper animations in place of static images
* Stealing music is not ok
* movement should be fixed to the lines, rather then "fluid" as it is now.
